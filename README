This is a extended "replacement" of rb(report browser).

Created in document/view manner. rbx returns list of tuples or tuple and rbx_inets, rbx_cons are human
readable presentation of these data.

rbx_inets - web base view (use you favorite browser to explore logs)
rbx_cons - console view(like rb does)

How to build:

edit src/rbx_sup.erl uncomment CHILD(rbx_inets, worker, []) if you want to start web UI with
application start
or CHILD(rbx_cons, worker, []) is you still want console

then

./rebar compile

How to start:
application:start(rbx).

go http://localhost:8000 in you web browser
or
rbx_cons:list(show, ...) if you are freak :)

Possible config parameters:
- inets_port <port>     - http port can be configured via config file or "erl -rbx inets_port 8001"
- report_dir <path>     - path to logs. If no parameter is found, looking for sasl error_logger_mf_dir param.
                          Can be configured the same way as inets_port. E.g. "erl -rbx report_dir "/tmp/log""
- start_log  <filename> - rbx_cons will dump output into file instead of stdout
